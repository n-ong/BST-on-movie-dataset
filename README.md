# BST on movie dataset
In this assignment, we have given you datasets containing movie names and their ratings. Your goal is to implement a Binary Search Tree to store this information, measure and analyze the running time of searching for movies.

An overview of your goals are provided below:

Implement a Binary Search Tree to store movie names and ratings. Your BST should be sorted by movie name.
Your BST should provide a public function to search for a particular movie, search for movies that start with a specific prefix, and find the movie with the highest rating starting with a particular prefix.
Measure the absolute running time of your search functions and how it scales with input size.
Analyze the Big-O running time for different types of search.
Write a report to discuss the trends in running times using your mathematical analysis to explain the performance data that you collected.
